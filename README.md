## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run server** to start the local server

#### Express JS

Why did you choose this framework?
- Express has a large community of users.
- Express is the most matured framework for Node.js with 5+ years of use.
- Express offers a quick and simple way to get a server up and running.

## Actions

ðŸš« This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

`getOrgs()` -> Returns all organizations

`getOrg(orgId)` -> Returns a single organization by ID

`addOrg(org)` -> Returns the created org

`updateOrg(orgId)` -> Update an organization by ID

`deleteOrg(orgId)` -> Delete an organization by ID
<br>
<br>
<br>
`getUsers(orgId)` -> if no param all users

`getUser(userId)` -> Returns a single user by user ID

`addUser(user object)` --> Creates a new user and returns that user. Also creates 7 availabilities defaulted to hours of operation for their organization.

`updateUser(userId, changes object)` -> Updates a single user by ID.

`deleteUser(userId)` -> deletes everything dependent on the user

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:
    
    *  OKTA_CLIENT_ID=
    *  OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=
    *  OIDC_OKTA_DOMAIN=
    *  OKTA_REGISTER_TOKEN=
    *  AT_API_KEY=
    *  JWT_SECRET=
    *  FRONTEND_URL=
    *  DEV_CON=
    *  TEST_CON=
    *  EMAIL_USERNAME=
    *  EMAIL_PASSWORD=
    *  DB_ENV=

OKTA_CLIENT_ID -- Once you have your okta app created, under the client credentials section of your app's settings, you will find your client ID and client secret.

OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET -- Once you have your okta app created, under the client credentials section of your app's settings, you will find your client ID and client secret.

OIDC_OKTA_DOMAIN -- Set this to your okta app's domain. You will need to sign up for an okta developer account and create an app. From there you will get your app's URL.

OKTA_REGISTER_TOKEN -- A token that needs to be created on the okta developer control panel, under "api -> tokens". This token seems to expire a month after initial creation and the expiration date extends for another month from the date last used, so every time a new user registers an account, the expiration date extends to a month from that time.

AT_API_KEY -- Can be any string(?). Is required for functionality but not exactly sure what it does.

JWT_SECRET -- Can be any string. Used for creating the app's JWT token and decoding it.

FRONTEND_URL -- Set this to your frontend's URL. If you are using a local frontend, use http://localhost:port. If you are using a deployed frontend, use your frontend's URL.

DEV_CON -- The connection string used to access the development environment on the knexfile. Example: DEV_CON=postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@localhost/DATABASENAME

TEST_CON -- The connection string used to access the testing environment on the knexfile. Example: TEST_CON=postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@localhost/DATABASENAME

EMAIL_USERNAME -- The gmail account username that will receive all the contact information and the publish submissions.

EMAIL_PASSWORD -- The gmail account's password.

DB_ENV -- For deployment, this should be set to "production" to use the production environment or it will default to "development". See "./database/dbConfig.js" for details.

## Notes

#### Reset Password Page
When a user registers an account on the application, recovery questions and answers are not required, therefore a user cannot request a self-service password reset because by default okta requires a recovery question and recovery answer to reset a password.

The email sent to a user when resetting their email will not be a self-service email until the setting within "password policy -> account recovery -> additional self-service recovery option -> security question" is unchecked. This option by default, when creating a new okta app, will not be available. 

You MUST contact okta support, create a ticket, and ask them to enable this option for your application. Once this option is available you can uncheck the option and save.
